# DAT250 experiment 4

Only had time for experiment 1 and 2 so I skipped the optional 3 and 4

My fork of the project, with subsequent workflow run can be found [here](https://github.com/madsnesse/dat250-sparkjava-counter)

What took most time on this exercise was familiarizing myself with the spark framework. Didn't really have many issues, 
except not all tests were passing at first, but after actually reading what the tests wanted it was pretty straight forward :)
Also made some postman requests to test the api. which can be found [here](https://github.com/madsnesse/dat250-sparkjava-counter/blob/master/postman.json)
